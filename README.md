  ## Description

  The purpose of the application is to give the user a place to easily store their favorite books.

  The app was originallu built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.  We have refracctored it to use an Apollo Server utilizing GraphQl queries and mutations to modify data; modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API; and created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
